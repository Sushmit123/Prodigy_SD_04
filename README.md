ðŸŒŸ Thrilled to showcase my latest project at Prodigy Infotech: a Sudoku solver implemented in Java! 

ðŸ’»In this project, I've developed a Sudoku-solving algorithm using Java that efficiently tackles the classic puzzle. The code includes functions to check the safety of placing a number in a given position, a recursive helper function to solve the Sudoku, and a main method to take user input and display the solved Sudoku board.

Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or use it as a reference for your own projects! ðŸ”§ðŸš€
